Communications and control networks are protected","檢測到您的伺服器有 BREACH（CVE-2013-3587）漏洞。BREACH 漏洞 CRIME 漏洞類似，皆為 SSL/TLS 壓縮功能設計不當所導致，不過 BREACH 漏洞特別針對 HTTP 壓縮功能，且與 SSL/TLS 版本或是使用的加密套件無關。若 HTTP 壓縮功能開啟，則使駭客可以利用資料在 SSL/TLS 壓縮前後的長度與內容關聯性，透過壓縮不同資料，觀察並推論出加密資料中的機密資訊。
要達成此攻擊有三個條件：
• 頁面中沒有無法預測的元素，例如某欄位放隨機值
• 發起的請求中含有機敏資訊，例如 session cookie 或其他 PII
• 攻擊者能劫持並修改請求與回應，藉此觀察訊息長度與內容

BREACH, similar to CRIME, is due to implementation errors in the SSL/TLS compression functionality in the OpenSSL library, especially in the HTTP compression component. This vulnerability affects all versions of SSL/TLS. When HTTP compression is enabled, an adversary can deduce the contents of the transmitted information by observing the difference and correlation of the returned compressed data. 
To accomplish a BREACH attack, 3 conditions must be met:
1.	There are no unpredictable values, such as random tokens, in the webpage.
2.	The request contains sensitive data, such as session cookies or identity tokens.
3.	The adversary may send and receive requests on behalf of the victim, either by intercepting or other methods of observing data.

According to the RFC, the maximum allowed number of DNS queries required to validate a SPF record is 10. Any DNS lookup, indirect or recursive, triggered by the a, mx, ptr, exists, include, and redirect mechanisms is counted.

Misuse of SPF mechanisms may cause the receiving server to ignore your SPF record and reject your emails.","為避免此風險，建議參照以下準則：
•造成此錯誤最常見的原因，是使用過多的 include 機制，導致 DNS 查詢次數倍數增長。其中一個解法是直接列出所有允許的 IP 位置，但缺點是當使用的寄信服務更動其 IP 時，您的紀錄也必須隨之更新。另一個解法是使用多個子網域，切分個別寄信網域，這樣每個子網域都有 10 次 DNS 查詢空間，相應的缺點是寄出的信件上寄件者的網域無法統一，可能導致客戶混淆。
請參考：https://tech-blog.cymetrics.io/posts/crystal/email-sec-settings-spf/#第三方服務","To mitigate this vulnerability, we suggest the following:
• The problem is most often due to excessively using the ""include"" mechanisms for third party services, thus multiplying the number of DNS queries. One solution would be to expand the included records and list out all IPs, but this method comes with the hassle of updating your record whenever any of your providers do. Another common solution is to divide the sending domain into several subdomains and split the original record so that each domain can have their own provider-specific record and quota of ten lookups. The downside to this method is that emails sent from your domain may carry several different domain names and may potentially confuse customers.
